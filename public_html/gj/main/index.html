              Game Jam is a contest where participants utilize their skills and knowledges to make a game from scratch with a time constraint.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants might work independently, or in teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants are generally programmers, game designers, artists, writers, and others in game development-related fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditionally, game jam focuses on video games; however, board games have also been the subject of game jams. We are extremely exciting to see well-designed board games!!
